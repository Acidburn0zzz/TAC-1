# jQuery Foundation Working Groups

jQuery Foundation Working Groups (WG) are autonomous projects created by the
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). A WG may be appropriate when concerns or
needs cross multiple Foundation Projects or Collaboration Boards and the
represented Projects wish to coordinate their efforts. WGs may also be formed
for Foundation-wide technical initiatives that may or may not directly involve
or impact any single project.

Working Groups can be formed at any time but must be ratified by the TAC. Once
formed the work defined in the Working Group charter is the responsibility of
the Working Group rather than the TAC.

It is important that Working Groups are not formed pre-maturely. Working Groups
are not formed to *begin* a set of tasks but instead are formed once that work
is already underway and those involved think it would benefit from being done as
an autonomous project. The exception to this rule is Foundation-wide technical
initiatives where formation of a Working Group in order to define and organize
the work would be desirable.

If the work defined in a Working Group charter is completed, the Working Group
should be dissolved and the responsibility for governance absorbed back into the
TAC or other appropriate governing body as defined in the Working Group charter.
A Working Group can be dissolved either through consensus of the Working Group
membership or normal TAC motion and vote.
