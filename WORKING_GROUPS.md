# jQuery Foundation Working Groups

jQuery Foundation Working Groups (WG) are autonomous projects created by the
Collaboration Board (CB). A WG may be appropriate when concerns or needs cross
multiple Foundation Projects or Technical Steering Committees and the projects
wish to coordinate their efforts.

Working Groups can be formed at any time but must be ratified by the CB. Once
formed the work defined in the Working Group charter is the responsibility of
the Working Group rather than the CB.

It is important that Working Groups are not formed pre-maturely. Working Groups
are not formed to *begin* a set of tasks but instead are formed once that work
is already underway and those involved think it would benefit from being done as
an autonomous project.

If the work defined in a Working Group charter is completed, the Working Group
should be dissolved and the responsibility for governance absorbed back into the
CB. A Working Group can be dissolved either through consensus of the Working
Group membership or normal CB motion and vote.
