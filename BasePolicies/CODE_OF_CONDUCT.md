## Technical Steering Committee and Working Group Code of Conduct Template

Every Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and Working Group (WG) must have a Code
of Conduct. By default, all repositories under the jQuery Foundation owned
GitHub organizations fall under the [jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct][], but
TSCs and WGs can choose to define their own alternative policy. If the TC or WG
does choose it's own Code of Conduct, it must be documented in a
`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file located in the root of any repository under their
stewardship.

Note that the Code of Conduct adopted by a TSC or WG will be evaluated by the CB
prior to ratifying the proposed charter. If that Code of Conduct is considered
to be weaker than, or diverges too significantly from, the
[jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct][], the CB may defer accepting the charter
until corrections are made.

Likewise, if the Code of Conduct changes after the TSC or WG has already been
chartered and the CB determines that the updated Code of Conduct is weaker than,
or diverges too significantly from, the [jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct][],
the CB or any Collaborator may request that further corrections be made by
opening an issue or a PR in the TSC's or WG's repository. Should the TSC or WG
choose not to adopt the recommended changes, the TSC's or WG's charter may be
revoked.
