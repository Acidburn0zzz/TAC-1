## Technical Steering Committee and Working Group Moderation Policy Template

Every Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and Working Group (WG) must have a
Moderation Policy. By default, all repositories under the jQuery Foundation
owned GitHub organizations fall under the
[jQuery Foundation Moderation Policy][], but TSCs and WGs can choose to define
their own alternative policy. If the TSC or WG does choose it's own Moderation
Policy, it must be documented in a `ModerationPolicy.md` file located in the
root of any repository under their stewardship.

Note that the Moderation Policy adopted by a TSC or WG will be evaluated by the
CB or TSC respectively prior to ratifying the proposed charter. If that
Moderation Policy is considered to be weaker than, or diverges too significantly
from, the [jQuery Foundation Moderation Policy][], the CB or TSC may defer
accepting the charter until corrections are made.

Likewise, if the Moderation Policy changes after the TSC or WG has already been
chartered and the CB or TSC determines that the updated Moderation Policy is
weaker than, or diverges too significantly from, the
[jQuery Foundation Moderation Policy][], the CB, TSC or any Collaborator may
request that further corrections be made by opening an issue or a PR in the
TSC's or WG's repository. Should the TSC or WG choose not to adopt the
recommended changes, the TSC's or WG's charter may be revoked.
