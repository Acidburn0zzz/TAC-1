## Establishing a new Technical Steering Committee or Working Group

A Technical Steering Committee (TSC) or Working Group (WG) is established by
first defining a charter that can be ratified by the CB or a TSC respectively. A
charter is a *statement of purpose*, a *list of responsibilities* and a *list of
initial membership*.

A WG needs at least 3 initial members while a TSCs initial membership is
determined by the number of Projects involved and is defined in the TSC's
Governance.md. These should be individuals already undertaking the work
described in the charter.

The list of responsibilities should be specific. Once established, a WG's
responsibilities are no longer governed by the TSC and therefore should not be
broad or subjective. The only recourse a TSC has over a WG is to revoke the
entire charter and take on the work previously done by the working group
themselves. The only recourse the CB has over a TSC is to revoke the entire
charter and either move the projects into other TSC(s) or back into incubation
when necessary.

If the responsibilities described in the charter are currently undertaken by
another TSC or WG then the charter will additionally have to be ratified by that
TSC or WG.

You can submit the TSC or WG charter for ratification by sending a Pull Request
that adds the charter to the WORKING_GROUPS.md document, which adds it to the
list of current TSCs or WGs. The TSC or WG is considered to be chartered once
that PR lands. Once ratified the list of members should be maintained in the
TSC's or WG's README.

### Base Policies for new Technical Steering Committees and Working Groups

Once the CB or TSC ratifies a charter, the new TSC or WG inherits the policies
established by the CB or TSC for governance, contribution, conduct and an MIT
LICENSE. New TSCs and WGs are free to change these documents through their own
governance process but should retain at least the spirit of the original
versions. The template documents provided in this directory are provided to help
bootstrap that process:
