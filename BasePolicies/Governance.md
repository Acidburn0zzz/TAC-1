## CB, WG and Project Governance

Every technical governing body over Projects in the Foundation must have a
documented governance model that describes its basic operation. This must be
documented in the appropriate repository and referenced by the `README.md`.

## Starting a CB or WG

A Collaboration Board (CB) or Working Group (WG) is established by first
defining a charter that can be ratified by the Technical Advisory Committee
(TAC). A charter is a *statement of purpose*, a *list of responsibilities* and a
*list of initial membership*.

A technical governing body needs 3 initial members. These should be individuals
already undertaking the work described in the charter.

The list of responsibilities should be specific. The only recourse the TAC has
over a Working Group is to revoke the entire charter and take on the work
previously done by the Working Group themselves or charter a new Working Group
to take on that work.

If the responsibilities described in the charter are currently undertaken by
another governing body then the charter will additionally have to be ratified by
that governing body.

You can submit a CB or WG charter for ratification by sending a Pull Request to
the TAC's README.md for new CBs while new WGs send a Pull Request to the TAC's
WORKING_GROUPS.md document. The CB or WG is considered to be chartered once that
PR lands. Once ratified the list of members should be maintained in the CB's or
WG's README.

## Bootstrap Governance

Once the TAC ratifies a charter, the governing body inherits the following
documentation for governance, contribution, conduct and an MIT LICENSE. The governing body is free to change these documents through their own governance process,
hence the term "bootstrap". It is recommended when starting a CB or WG that the
[CB and WG Charter Template][] be used.
