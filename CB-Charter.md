# Collaboration Board (CB) Charter

## Section 1. Guiding Principle.

The Collaboration Board will operate transparently, openly, collaboratively, and
ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status must not merely be open, but
also easily visible to outsiders.

## Section 2. Evolution of jQuery Foundation Governance

Most large, complex open source communities have both a business and a technical
governance model. jQuery Foundation's technical leadership contains a
Collaboration Board ("CB"), Technical Steering Committees ("TSC"s) and Projects
which may represent a single or collection of code bases. jQuery Foundation's
business leadership is instantiated in a Board of Directors (the "Board”).

This Collaboration Board Charter reflects a carefully constructed,
balanced role for the CB and the Board in the governance of the jQuery
Foundation. The charter amendment process is for the CB to propose changes
using simple majority of the full CB, the proposed changes being subject to
review and approval by the Board. The Board may additionally make amendments to
the CB charter at any time, though the Board will not interfere with day-to-day
discussions, votes or meetings of the CB.

## Section 3. Board's Role in Setting jQuery Foundation's Strategic Direction

The Board will set the overall CB Policy through [Foundation mission and vision
statements][] as well as within the [Foundation bylaws][]. The policy will
describe the overarching scope of the jQuery Foundation initiative and jQuery
Foundation's technical vision and direction. The Board will use the CB as a
delegate body for governing high-level technical policy and procedures, TSC
scope and direction while they remain within the scope and direction of the
policies as described in the CB Policy and approved by the Board.

## Section 4. Establishment of the CB

CB memberships are time-limited to 1 year terms with no limit on the number of
terms a member may serve. There is no fixed size of the CB. However, the
expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate coverage of important
areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently. The
CB shall not exceed 20 members to ensure effectiveness.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for CB membership
beyond these rules. The CB may add additional members to the CB by a standard
CB motion and vote. A CB member may be removed from the CB by voluntary
resignation, or by a standard CB motion. An election will be held at the end of
each member's term.

Changes to CB membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be suggested
as any other agenda item.

No more than one-fourth of the CB members may be affiliated with the same
employer. If removal or resignation of a CB member, or a change of employment
by a CB member, creates a situation where more than one-fourth of the CB
membership shares an employer, then the situation must be immediately remedied
by the resignation or removal of one or more CB members affiliated with the
over-represented employer(s).

The CB members shall consist of a single representative from each TSC up to the
maximum number of members defined above.

The CB shall meet regularly using tools that enable participation by the
community (e.g. weekly on a Google Hangout On Air, or through any other
appropriate means selected by the CB). The meeting shall be directed by the CB
Chairperson. Minutes or an appropriate recording shall be taken and made
available to the community through accessible public postings.

## Section 5. Responsibilities of the CB and TSCs

Subject to such policies as may be set by the Board, the CB is responsible for
ensuring collaboration is the driving principle within a Project, between jQuery
Foundation Projects, and between jQuery Foundation Projects and the broader
community. The CB is also responsible for mediating technical conflicts between
jQuery Foundation Projects. Specific technical decisions within a Project will
be the responsibility of the Project with input from the TSC and any related WGs
for that Project, including:

* Setting release dates.
* Release quality standards.
* Technical direction.
* Project governance and process (including a charter similar to this document,
  ratified by the CB).
* GitHub repository hosting.
* Conduct guidelines.
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators.
* Development process and any coding standards.
* Mediating technical conflicts between Collaborators.

The CB will serve as jQuery Foundation's primary technical liaison body with
external open source projects, consortiums and groups and is also responsible
for technical participation in standards bodies.

## Section 6. jQuery Foundation Operations

Following established foundation policies and under the guidance of the CB,
TSCs will establish and maintain a development process for jQuery Foundation
Projects. The development process will establish guidelines for how the
developers and community will operate. It will, for example, establish
appropriate timelines for TSC review (e.g. agenda items must be published at
least a certain number of hours in advance of a TSC meeting).

There will be multiple Projects under the jQuery Foundation organized by TSC.
The TSCs are responsible for organizing the Project structure, including
possibly the creation and alignment of sub-Projects. Each Project must be within
such policies as may be set by the Board and CB, have a well-defined scope and
must work within that scope. The development process will provide for Projects
to follow the lifecycle process as described in the Project Lifecycle document.
The development process will include a process for the TSC to occasionally
review and recommend changes to the lifecycle of a Project, which will include
consideration of the following criteria:

* Cleanliness of the code base;
* Ample and diverse Contributors and Collaborators to assure vitality of
the project;
* Stability (e.g. presence of test suites, stable APIs and use of an
  appropriate source-code control system);
* Predictability of releases;
* Alignment with the jQuery Foundation's goals and priorities.

The TSCs and entire technical community will follow any processes as may be
specified by the Board relating to the intake and license compliance review of
contributions, including the jQuery Foundation CLA and IP Policy.

## Section 7. Elections

Leadership roles in jQuery Foundation will be peer elected representatives of
the community.

For election of persons (CB members, CB Chairperson, TSC members, Maintainers,
etc.) a multiple-candidate method should be used, e.g.:

* [Condorcet][] or
* [Single Transferable Vote][]

Multiple-candidate methods may be reduced to simple election by plurality when
there are only two candidates for one position to be filled. No election is
required if there is only one candidate and no objections to the candidate's
election. Elections shall be done within the Projects by the Collaborators
active in the Project.

Each TSC shall elect from amongst voting TSC members a representative to serve
on the CB within the guidelines set forth in section 4 above.

The CB will elect from amongst voting CB members a CB Chairperson to work on
building an agenda for CB meetings and represent the CB to the Board of
Directors for a term of one year according to the jQuery Foundation's By-laws.
The CB shall hold annual elections to select a CB Chairperson; there are no
limits on the number of terms a CB Chairperson may serve.

## Section 8. Voting

For internal project decisions, Collaborators shall operate under Lazy
Consensus. The TSC for a project or group of projects shall establish
appropriate guidelines for implementing Lazy Consensus (e.g. expected
notification and review time periods) within the development process.

The TSCs and CB follow a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When an
agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does
anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a TSC/CB member can call for either
a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting. The call for a
vote must be seconded by a majority of the TSC/CB or else the discussion will
continue. Simple majority wins, with the following exceptions, which will
require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the CB to pass:

* Adding or removing members of the TSC or CB
* Changes to the TSC charter which also requires CB approval
* Changes to the CB charter which also requires Board approval

## Section 9. Project Roles

The jQuery Foundation Project repositories are maintained by the Projects, their
TSC and additional Collaborators who are added by the Project on an ongoing
basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions, “Contributor(s)”, are
made Collaborators and given commit-access to the Project. These individuals are
identified by the existing Collaborators for the Project and their addition as
Collaborators is discussed during Project meetings. Modifications of the
contents of the git repository are made on a collaborative basis as defined in
the development process.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial modifications, or
modifications that have not found consensus to the TSC for discussion by
assigning the `TSC-agenda` tag to a pull request or issue. The TSC should serve
as the final arbiter where required. The TSC will maintain and publish a list of
current Collaborators by Project, as well as a development process guide for
Collaborators and Contributors looking to participate in the development effort.

## Section 10. Definitions

**Project**: a technical collaboration effort that is organized through the
project creation process and approved by the TSC.

**Contributors**: contribute code or other artifacts, but do not have the right
to commit to the code base. Contributors work with the Project's Collaborators
to have code committed to the code base. A Contributor may be promoted to a
Collaborator by the project's Maintainer or TSC. Contributors should rarely be
encumbered by the TSC and never by the CB nor Board.

**Collaborator**: a Contributor within a Project that has made significant and
valuable contributions and has been given commit-access to that Project
repository.

**Maintainer**: a Collaborator within a Project elected to represent the Project
on the TSC.
