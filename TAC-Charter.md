# Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) Charter

## Section 1. Guiding Principle.

The Technical Advisory Committee will operate transparently, openly,
collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status must
not merely be open, but also easily visible to outsiders.

## Section 2. Evolution of jQuery Foundation Governance

Most large, complex open source communities have both a business and a technical
governance model. jQuery Foundation's technical leadership contains a Technical
Advisory Committee ("TAC"), Collaboration Boards ("CB"s), Working Groups ("WG"s)
and Projects which may represent a single or collection of code bases. jQuery
Foundation's business leadership is instantiated in a Board of Directors (the
"Board‚Äù).

This Technical Advisory Committee Charter reflects a carefully constructed,
balanced role for the TAC and the Board in the governance of the jQuery
Foundation. The charter amendment process is for the TAC to propose changes
using simple majority of the full TAC, the proposed changes being subject to
review and approval by the Board. The Board may additionally make amendments to
the TAC charter at any time, though the Board will not interfere with day-to-day
discussions, votes or meetings of the TAC.

## Section 3. Board's Role in Setting jQuery Foundation's Strategic Direction

The Board will set the overall TAC Policy through [Foundation mission and vision
statements][] as well as within the [Foundation bylaws][]. The policy will
describe the overarching scope of the jQuery Foundation initiative and jQuery
Foundation's technical vision and direction. The Board will use the TAC as a
delegate body for governing high-level technical policy and procedures as well
as TAC scope and direction while they remain within the scope and direction of
the policies as described in the TAC Policy and approved by the Board.

## Section 4. Establishment of the TAC

TAC memberships are time-limited to 1 year terms with no limit on the number of
terms a member may serve. There is no fixed size of the TAC and membership will
consist of:

1. A representative from each Project (if desired)
2. A representative from each jQuery Foundation Member organization (if desired)
3. Individuals from the greater JS community as appointed by the existing TAC or
the Board

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for TAC membership
beyond these rules. The TAC may add additional members from the JS community to
the TAC by a standard TAC motion and vote as described in the [Voting][] section
of this charter. A TAC member, including those appointed by Projects and Member
organizations may be removed from the TAC by voluntary resignation, or by a
standard TAC motion and vote. If the removed member is a Project or Member
organization representative, that Project or Member organization may appoint a
new representative. The removed member may again be considered for addition to
the TAC after a term of 1 year from their removal. At the end of a member's
term, that term may be renewed for an additional term by a standard TAC motion
and vote.

Changes to TAC membership should be posted in the TAC meeting agenda, and may be
suggested as any other agenda item.

No more than one-fourth of the TAC members may be affiliated with the same
employer. If removal or resignation of a TAC member, or a change of employment
by a TAC member, creates a situation where more than one-fourth of the TAC
membership shares an employer, then the situation must be immediately remedied
by the resignation or removal of one or more TAC members affiliated with the
over-represented employer(s) or the addition of a new representative not
affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).

The TAC shall meet regularly using tools that enable participation by the
community (e.g. quarterly on a Google Hangout On Air, or through any other
appropriate means selected by the TAC). The meeting shall be directed by the TAC
Chairperson. Minutes or an appropriate recording shall be taken and made
available to the community through accessible public postings.

## Section 5. Responsibilities of the TAC and CBs

Subject to such policies as may be set by the Board, the TAC is responsible for
ensuring collaboration is the driving principle within a Project, between jQuery
Foundation Projects, and between jQuery Foundation Projects and the broader
community. The TAC is also responsible for admitting new projects to the
mentorship program as well as graduating projects from the mentorship program.
The TAC is also responsible for mediating technical conflicts between jQuery
Foundation Projects. Specific technical decisions within a Project will be the
responsibility of the Project or if the project is a member of a CB, as defined
by the CB charter, including:

* Setting release dates.
* Release quality standards.
* Technical direction.
* Project governance and process.
* GitHub repository hosting.
* Conduct guidelines.
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators.
* Development process and any coding standards.
* Mediating technical conflicts between Collaborators.

The TAC will serve as the jQuery Foundation's primary technical liaison body
with external open source projects, consortiums and groups and is also
responsible for technical participation in standards bodies.

## Section 6. jQuery Foundation Operations

Following established Foundation policies and under the guidance of the TAC,
CBs will establish and maintain a development process for jQuery Foundation
Projects. The development process will establish guidelines for how the
developers and community will operate. It will, for example, establish
appropriate timelines for CB review (e.g. agenda items must be published at
least a certain number of hours in advance of a CB meeting).

There will be multiple Projects under the jQuery Foundation organized by CB or a
group of At-large Projects. The CBs are responsible for organizing the Project
structure, including possibly the creation and alignment of sub-Projects. Each
Project must be within such policies as may be set by the Board and TAC, have a
well-defined scope and must work within that scope. The development process will
provide for Projects to follow the lifecycle process as described in the Project
Lifecycle document. The development process will include a process for the CB
to occasionally review and recommend changes to the lifecycle of a Project,
which will include consideration of the following criteria:

* Cleanliness of the code base;
* Ample and diverse Contributors and Collaborators to assure vitality of
the project;
* Stability (e.g. presence of test suites, stable APIs and use of an
  appropriate source-code control system);
* Predictability of releases;
* Alignment with the jQuery Foundation's goals and priorities.

The CBs and entire technical community will follow any processes as may be
specified by the Board relating to the intake and license compliance review of
contributions, including the jQuery Foundation CLA and IP Policy.

## Section 7. Decision Making

For internal Project decisions, Collaborators shall operate under Lazy
Consensus. The CB for a Project or group of Projects shall establish
appropriate guidelines for implementing Lazy Consensus (e.g. expected
notification and review time periods) within the development process.

The CBs and TAC follow a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When an
agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does
anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CB/TAC member can call for either a
closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting. Votes shall
follow the procedure described in the [Voting][] section of this charter.

## Section 8. Voting

Voting should only be used when consensus can not be reached through usual
collaborative processes or in the case of elections as described in the
[Elections][] section of this charter. The call for a vote must be seconded by a
majority of the CB/TAC or else the discussion and attempt to reach consensus
will continue. Simple majority wins a vote, with the following exceptions, which
will require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the CB/TAC to
pass:

* Adding or removing members of the CB or TAC
* Changes to the CB charter which also requires TAC approval
* Changes to the TAC charter which also requires Board approval

## Section 9. Elections

Leadership roles in the jQuery Foundation's technical organization will be peer
elected representatives of the community.

For election of persons (TAC members, TAC Chairperson, CB members, Maintainers,
etc.) a multiple-candidate method should be used, e.g.:

* [Condorcet][] or
* [Single Transferable Vote][]

Multiple-candidate methods may be reduced to simple election by plurality when
there are only two candidates for one position to be filled. No election is
required if there is only one candidate and no objections to the candidate's
election.

Elections shall be done within the Projects by the Collaborators active in the
Project. Each Project may elect one representative to the TAC and that
representative may be anyone from that project community.

Foundation supporting Member organizations may elect one representative to the
TAC and may use what ever means they deem fit to determine the individual who
will fill that role.

The TAC will elect from amongst voting TAC members a TAC Chairperson to work on
building an agenda for TAC meetings and represent the TAC to the Board of
Directors for a term of one year according to the jQuery Foundation's By-laws.
The TAC shall hold annual elections to select a TAC Chairperson; there are no
limits on the number of terms a TAC Chairperson may serve.

## Section 10. Project Roles

The jQuery Foundation Project repositories are maintained by the Projects, their
CB and additional Collaborators who are added by the Project on an ongoing
basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions, ‚ÄúContributor(s)‚Äù, are
made Collaborators and given commit-access to the Project. These individuals are
identified by the existing Collaborators for the Project and their addition as
Collaborators is discussed during Project meetings. Modifications of the
contents of the git repository are made on a collaborative basis as defined in
the development process.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial modifications, or
modifications that have not found consensus to the CB for discussion by
assigning the `CB-agenda` tag to a pull request or issue. The CB should serve as
the final arbiter where required. The Project will maintain and publish a list
of current Collaborators, as well as a development process guide, within the
guidelines set forth in the Project's CB charter, for Collaborators and
Contributors looking to participate in the development effort.

## Section 11. Definitions

**Project**: a technical collaboration effort that is organized through the
project mentorship process and approved by the TAC.

**Contributors**: contribute code or other artifacts, but do not have the right
to commit to the code base. Contributors work with the Project's Collaborators
to have code committed to the code base. A Contributor may be promoted to a
Collaborator by the Project's Maintainers or CB. Contributors should rarely be
encumbered by the CB and never by the TAC nor Board.

**Collaborator**: a Contributor within a Project that has made significant and
valuable contributions and has been given commit-access to that Project
repository.

**Maintainer**: a Collaborator within a Project elected to represent the Project
on the CB or other official role as defined in the Project's governance
policies.
